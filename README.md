## Week 1 Reflection

  I started attending NONE4763 on April 19th First week of class and I already had trouble finding the class, who designs the rooms from 1 to 10 then jumps to 41. I asked around but no one could be of use. I finally got to class about 30 minutes late but the professor Crellin didn’t mind. The first week consisted of welcoming and introduction, which was boring for the most part. The professor was quite different though, he asked the class about their future major, discusses with the students about their majors and sometimes gives advice and tips on what one should do in regards to their field of study. This was actually my first time seeing someone actively engaging with their students without them coming to the professors first, and I could get that, try doing that in an auditorium with over 100 people and see how long that’ll take. Regardless, professor Crellin asked me about what my major is and why I chose it. Due to my relative’s connections, I could ask to work under them in the private sector under an aerospace and defense contractor. Being a corporation that offers arms services, most people wouldn’t like the notion of working for such places, and it reflects in their conversation with me. Professor Crellin, though, said it was an interesting path and briefly sat down to talk more about the topic, mostly revolving around viewpoints and morals. Thanks to our brief conversation, I was able to sit back and contemplate my career choices. Some of the information that we talked about regarding the ethics of such works really opened my eyes on how I should consider other factors such as being involved in a lot of paperwork, government red tape, etc. On the other hand, this industry is really slow, it doesn’t require as much critical thinking as, say, in artificial intelligence, I started programming because of the paycheck, but again, the talk with Professor Crellin did help with my growth in thinking a bit more in-depth about the path that I chose. I do hope the lessons in the following weeks would help me in the same capacity.
